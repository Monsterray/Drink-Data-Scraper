If your orange peels are much more or less aromatic than average, adjust the quantity so that you have enough to hide the maple flavor, without having enough to make the liqueur bitter or recognizably orange flavored.		31.3 oz serving	alchoholPercent=20%	protein=2.5 g	alcohol=181.4 g	fat=0.6 g	carbohydrates=357.9 g	calories=3741	sodium=13 mg	fiber=6.3 g	cholesterol=0 mg	energy=15654	sugar=340.1 g
