Peel the oranges, take out the pips and cut them into small cubes. Warm the orange juice, the sugar and the mandarin peels until the sugar dissolves. Mix all the ingredients - except the ice and the soda. The ice and the soda add just before serving.			alchoholPercent=0
Sangria Liqueur - Sweet				lemons:several	Fresca&reg; grapefruit soda:2 cans	red wine:2 bottles	oranges:several	apples:several	limes:several	sugar:1 cup		Melt the sugar in a couple of cups of hot water. I do this so I don't end up with a lot of undissolved sugar in the end. Cut apples into small chunks (1" or so)the apples absorb the wine the most, so I tend to use a lot of apples. Peel the citrus fruits (lemons and limes are difficult to peel) and break into wedges. Mix the wine, sugar, fruit, and Fresca and put in the fridge for a few hours. I tend to take out the lemons and limes before serving because they get slimy and no one wants to munch on them anyway. Serve in an iced tea glass with a straw and one of those cocktail swords so your guests can get at the fruit without getting their fingers sticky.			alchoholPercent=0
Sangria Liqueur - The World's Best				orange:1 large sliced	apple:1 large sectioned	brandy:3 - 4 oz	lemon:1 large sliced	sugar:1 cup	Cabernet Sauvignon red wine:1 1/2 liters		1. Mix ingredients together in a large container, stir, and let sit in a refrigerator for 18-24 hours. Note: A much more delightful sangria is produced when the fruit juice blends with the wine by osmmosis rather than by stirring. 2. Before serving, stir again, and add sugar or brandy to taste. It should be fairly strong and fairly sweet, almost syrupy. Then, cut the mixture with some sort of bubbly water, orange or lemon flavored if possibly, but plain bubbly water is fine, until it seems to have a thinner, more wine like consistency. Serve immediately.			alchoholPercent=0
