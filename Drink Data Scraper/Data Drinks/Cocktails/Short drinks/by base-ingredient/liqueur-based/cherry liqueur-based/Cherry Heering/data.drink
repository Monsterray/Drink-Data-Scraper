Darkwood Sling		Cocktail Glass		ice cubes:	soda water:1 part	Heering&reg; cherry liqueur:1 part	orange juice:1 part		There are many good cherry liqueurs you can use, but I prefer Heering. Add one share of the liqueur. Then you add one share of Soda. For a sour sling use Tonic (most people prefer the drink without Tonic). Afterwards you fill the glass with Orange Juice and ice cubes.			alchoholPercent=7%
