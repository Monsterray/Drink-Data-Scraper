Monkey Brain		Shot Glass		Bailey's&reg; Irish cream:	apfelkorn liqueur:2 cl		Fill a shot glass with apfelkorn almost to the rim. Carefully pour a little bailey's into the glass. The two liquors don't mix if poured correctly, and the bailey's will sink to the bottom as a nasty looking blob, not unlike a brain.			alchoholPercent=0
